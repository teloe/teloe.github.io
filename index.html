                        <p>Before I was a web developer, I managed an insurance agency.</p>

                        <p>Six years in, I built our branch's website. I enjoyed the process so much that I changed careers.</p>

                        <p>During my transition into tech, I attended a coding bootcamp to sharpen my skills and gained a solid foundation of knowledge.</p>

                        <p>Now, over three years later, I work at an industry-leading medical marketing company where I build websites that help drive practice growth and patient acquisition for clients all over the world.</p>

                        <p>I'm always open to new opportunities and love helping others when I can.</p>

                            <p>Tom came to NKP and made an immediate impact in our development team. He was able to pick up our workflow quickly and be an effective, self-sufficient developer. From the very first website he built, I noticed his attention to detail, passion for his work, and his determination to always learn and improve. His pride in his work showed and clients were always very impressed and happy with his projects.</p> 
                            <p>Tom's responsibilities included building websites from custom psd mockups made by our design team. His code was excellent and websites were unique and innovative.</p>
                            <p>Aside from being a significant asset to NKP, Tom was a pleasure to work with. He was always thoughtful, considerate, willing to help others, and an excellent team player who can also work independently and do a fantastic job.</p>

                        <blockquote>
                            <p>Tom has shown that he is a reliable coworker, a quick learner, and adaptable to change. He has been able to come to NKP with less experience than most of the people in our development team and grown into an excellent website builder.  He is dedicated to learning more and more about his craft everyday.</p>
                            <p>Beyond his ability to learn, his curiosity, and his dedication to his work, he also brings with him the ability to time manage. He is always communicative and helpful, and brings a lot of ideas to the table when it comes to improving our workflow as a group. He is not afraid to ask questions and is always there to help out his team.</p>
